Thanks for dropping by my little nook on the web. My name is Dan, and I am a web developer and IT generalist. I am also a small business owner. Currently I am working full-time in the public sector.

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, and have been doing so since the mid-1980s. When possible, I like to record my music, and hope to post some of those recordings here. I also love photography and will post some pictures every now and then.

Thanks again for dropping by, and if you'd like to reach out to me, you can [email me](mailto:hello@dankennedy.me) or visit my [small business'](https://valleyapps.us) website.
