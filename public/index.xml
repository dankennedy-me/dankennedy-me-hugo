      <description>Thanks for dropping by my little nook on the web. My name is Dan, and I am a web developer and IT generalist. I am also a small business owner. Currently I am working full-time in the public sector.
In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, and have been doing so since the mid-1980s. When possible, I like to record my music, and hope to post some of those recordings here.</description>
